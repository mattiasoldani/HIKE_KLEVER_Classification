# HIKE_KLEVER_Classification

This is a set of preliminary studies performed in 2023 on the signal/background classification performance at the CERN HIKE (High Intensity Kaon Experiments) experiment, KLEVER (K-Long Experiment for VEry Rare events) phase. These studies were performed on datasets generated with the [zOptical]([url](https://gitlab.cern.ch/prin-klever/zOptical)) MC simulation software. In particular, events with two photons reconstructed in the Main Electromagnetic Calorimeter (and optionally in the PreShower Detector) and no other hits anywhere in the detector are considered from three decay channels:

- K-long into a pi-0 and two neutrino (PNN, BR~3e-11) &mdash; the channel of interest;
- K-long into two pi-0 (BR~0.864e-3), with two of the four resulting photons leaving the detector undetected;
- lambda-0 into a pi-0 and a neutron (BR~0.358).
